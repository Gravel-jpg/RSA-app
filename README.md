# RSA-app
Python based gui with functionality to create new public and private keys and decrypt/encrypt ciphertext with any given keys.

Note:
This software relies on two .txt files both contained inside the same directory as the .exe/.py
the files are config.txt and 300 digit primes.txt

1) copy the file path of the Keys folder (containing 'private_keys.txt' and 'public_keys.txt') into config.txt and save. This will allow the program to rerwite your keys if you ever decide to regenerate them
2)if you ever want to mess with some bigger primes or just add more than the already 29, place them inside '300 digit primes.txt'. Each line represents one unique prime number
3)Enjoy
